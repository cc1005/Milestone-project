First milestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This website is functioning as a mock-up of a website I will later create with copyrighted assets for an academic forum based in Ireland. This forum puts on annual events, and helps publish books on certain types of history. The website will contain information about the forum, details of the annual conference & other events, links to publications and conference posters, as well as contact details for the forum itself.


## UX
Given that many of the visitors to the website will not be particularly technically savvy (given the older, academic demographic of the target audience), the website will be designed as simply as possible, with little in the way of complicated transitions or changing/morphing elements.

The colour palette will be reserved to reflect the serious nature of the content. The posters produced by the other branch of the forum (which exist in real life, but have been fictionalised for the purposes of this assessment) were used as a loose guide to ensure consistency across all branches of the organisation. These posters were made using the website https://www.canva.com/. The website https://coolors.co/, recommended by another Code Institute graduate, was used to generate a colour scheme which I subsequently modified.

While I had originally planned to have several pages for the website, after consultation with my mentor we agreed that fewer pages would suit the simple and streamlined objectives better. This will result in more scrolling pages.

### Features Left to Implement


## Testing


## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/hschafer2017/HSCHAFER-Portfolio.git` into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.
